# User stories

Let's think about the way we want this thing to work...
The first step, to me is to describe the state of the art in the messaging system technologies.

## Current messaging/forum system

With current systems, you can: 

* create new private conversation (slack/skype/forum)
* add new posts to a given conversation (forum)
* create groups of discussion (slack)
* reference users in messages (twitter/slack)
* react to a specific message (reddit)
* edit a posted message

## problems in existing messaging/forum system

* cannot see nicely a message history
* cannot create a new message from a specific part of an existing message
* cannot create a new thread from an existing message

## expectations

So the primary focus, would be have a simple messaging system that can display messages from different users where each user can select a message from the conversation and add a reaction to it.  
The new reaction will either a new topic and defined as it or a simple answer to the current topic.  
Which means that a single topic may contain several conversation thread depending on the user interaction.
