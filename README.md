# thought-share

A way to smartly share thoughts 

## Project description

The first motivation for this project comes from the lack of ability for current instant messaging technologies to manage discussion threads that goes in separate ways.

We have already encouter some trouble when, in a discussion thread in a forum or in a IM window, you want to answer to a specific question that has popped up a few messages ago. Like this :

> Raj: Hey, does someone has seen the new star war movie yet?  
> Howard: My cousin says they are all the same.  
> Leonard: yeah, he's right, the 7th is a re-cooked of the 4th-5th-6th...  
> Sheldon: No, can't you see the deep different between them. The analogy of fascism and all the rest ?  
> Penny: Yeah, I did, and I liked it

How, in any way is it possible to manage a discussion when you want to separate a set of answer from the other when they are not relevant ?  
The current trick is to use some @ to reference the user you want to answer to.  
But it is hard to create multiple threads simply from a given conversation share.

The idea may be to see the thread discussion as a tree of posts where one can simply answer directly to a message without disturbing or being disturbed by other messages.  

At some point, you would even want to cut a message in multiple message in order to answer to a specific part of the message.
